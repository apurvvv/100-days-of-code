**Today's Progress**: SBT project setup for scala-coding-bat repository. Solving and writing test cases for exercises in Warmup-I questions series.

**Thoughts:** CodingBat is a project by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford that hosts coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python. I however is willing to solve these problems in Scala.
