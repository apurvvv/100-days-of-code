# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SBT project setup for scala-coding-bat repository. Solving and writing test cases for exercises in Warmup-I questions series.

**Thoughts:** CodingBat is a project by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford that hosts coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python. I however is willing to solve these problems in Scala.

### Day 5: January 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercises in CodingBat's Warmup-II section & started working on exercises in String-I section.

**Thoughts:** Writing test cases prior to working on logic helps in better understanding the problem as you get to spend more time thinking about the use cases in order to write the test cases.

**Thoughts:** Couple of problems are similar to problems in Warmup sections.
